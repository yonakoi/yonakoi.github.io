Ayuma: Bkun doesn’t actually hate Ayuma (of course, Ayuma doesn’t know this). Bkun’s emotions are a complex mess of being seen for the first time, and how uncomfortable that makes him, along with the fact that he and Ayuma are on opposite sides. Bkun can’t bring himself to trust Ayuma, even if he wanted to. So the best thing to do is to continue hiding himself away.<br>
…Despite this, however, Ayuma manages to bring out Bkun’s emotions. This peeves Bkun even more, irritates him, but more than anything, makes him angry at himself for being swayed after years of being able to hide himself away.<br>

Lore: Bkun's entire identity is a mystery. He's built this image of himself to be just another person on the street. No one knows where he came from, what his story is, and even what his name is, except for him - a secret he will take with himself to the grave. However, after Ayuma shows up, Bkun's mask, for the very first time, starts to slip...
