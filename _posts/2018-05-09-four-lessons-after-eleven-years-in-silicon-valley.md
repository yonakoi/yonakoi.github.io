Bkun - Ayuma is interested in Bkun because of how little is known about him; the more Bkun tries to hide it, the more Ayuma tries to pursue it. Ayuma’s competitiveness to get B-kun to open up grows into love, and A-kun is aware of his feelings, which turns into frustration. Ayuma’s behavior over time becomes obsessive - his actions towards B-kun can be viewed as acts of hate, making the player believe Ayuma has a deep hatred for B-kun – but it’s not B-kun he hates, but rather the situation – the fact that B-kun doesn’t feel the same way. Ayuma makes B-kun an actual living person with a story, rather than an unnoticed/unacknowledged stranger in the crowd. <br>

Lore: Ayuma is currently working as a part time bartender undercover to get more information for his case on a serial killer. During his time at the bar, he meets Bkun, and starts to struggle with his priorities for the case and his growing emotions for Bkun. 

Personality: Ayuma is someone who is confident and flirtatious (much to Bkuns dismay). He is a very sharp person, and can observe small details and read the room. In times of crisis he tends to be impulsive & reliant on gut feeling rather than his usual observance. 

Backstory: Ayuma has been alone for the majority of his life. Because of this, Ayuma has never experienced any sort of familial or intimate love, so he doesnt know the boundaries between attraction, love, and obsession, it all combines into one for him. Ayuma's loneliness only feeds into his behaviors around Bkun – him being alone his entire life is a vital part to his feelings towards Bkun and Bkun’s rejections.
