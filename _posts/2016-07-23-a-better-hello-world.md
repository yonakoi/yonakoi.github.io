Lore:

Personality: He has a permanent scowl on his face. He’s always angry, but not in an explosive way necessarily. He’s cruel and selfish, accomplishing any mission and doing whatever it takes to succeed.

Backstory: 

Trivia:
He suffers from insomnia
He has an illness that comes from his mix of human and youkai blood. This in itself is a very rare occurrence and he got that 1/99 chance.
This illness occurs when there’s more human genetics than youkai. When this happens however, the youkai genes become poisonous
This causes his body to sometimes flare up in pain as he erm spits out blood or something idk read my in laws r obsessed with me because that has a good visual representation
This is his most vulnerable state. The only person who knows about this illness is his brother, Kaori. 
He looks almost exactly like his mother, and even more so because of his anger
Kaori doesn’t mean to, but he sometimes flinches/shows a slight hint of fear on his face whenever Gaki gets mad. This causes a slight strain in their relationship, because Gaki knows exactly why
He’s constantly in turmoil with his identity over being human or youkai. He doesn’t want to accept being human because that means he’d be like his mother, and yet with this illness, it’s almost impossible to deny
He got one of his friends killed in hs #rip
He got his mentor killed when he joined Hamori, but not in the way u might think…
This mentor was CRUEL. She taught him how to be strong, but also how to snuff out emotional attachment
She set a guideline that he will never be able to surpass her until he kills her. To be able to do that, he both needs to be physically… and emotionally able
They did grow close, with an almost family-like relationship. However, because of her criteria, Gaki was forced to kill someone close to him
Back to his whole identity crisis thing, he covers his hands with gloves because his fingertips are black. They look like this due to his youkai genetics. He also tends to stay away from mirrors, both because of his similarity to his mother, but also his golden eyes.
This is a complete oxymoron on how he thinks vs how he acts. He wants to be a youkai, a monster, to snuff out his humanity, and yet, he avoids and hides the physical features that make him one

Powers/Abilities: Absolutely none. He is half human, after all. He gained his strength on his own. The only youkai qualities he has are part of his appearance (his hands, his eyes), and his blood too but it still looks human.
