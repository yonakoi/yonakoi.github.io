Relationships:<br>
Junichiro Ueno - What Gaki feels for Jun can only be called hatred. Those disgusting and vile emotions just have to be. It’s something so twisted, so complicated, that untying the knot would simply be impossible. If this isn’t hatred, if it’s possible that it’s something else… Well, there’s only one other emotion close to hatred. If it’s that, then it proves he really is human. Which is why it simply can’t be possible.<br>

Lore: 

Personality: He has a permanent scowl on his face. He’s always angry, but not in an explosive way necessarily. He’s cruel and selfish, accomplishing any mission and doing whatever it takes to succeed.

Backstory: Gaki's mother never liked him, even from birth - she didn't intend to have him in the first place. She has always been an emotionally fragile woman. Despite falling in love with a youkai, she can't accept that her own kids are monsters. She wasn't as rough with Kaori, because he at least looked human. However, Gaki's eyes and hands were a constant reminder to his mother that he wasn't human. Because of this, Gaki's mother was incredibly abusive throughout his childhood, and she only got worse as time went on, lashing out to the rest of her family. One day, when Gaki was in high school, she just snapped. Gaki had a horrible argument with his best friend, and came home to see his father on the floor clutching Kaori. His mother started to lash out on him next, and he spotted a gun on the floor. In a panic, he grabbed it... Once his mother fell, he rushed over to his father and older brother. His father told him to go to Hamori with Kaori, before closing his eyes.<br>
Gaki's father was kind, but he was too kind. He always believed in Gaki's mother, and the love they had, so while he did his best to protect his kids, he was too soft to leave Gaki's mother.

Trivia:<br>
-He suffers from insomnia<br>
-He has an illness that comes from his mix of human and youkai blood. This in itself is a very rare occurrence and he got that 1/99 chance. This illness occurs when there’s more human genetics than youkai. When this happens however, the youkai genes become poisonous. This causes his body to sometimes flare up in pain as he spits out blood. This is his most vulnerable state. The only person who knows about this illness is his brother, Kaori.<br>
-He looks almost exactly like his mother, and even more so because of his anger<br>
-Kaori doesn’t mean to, but he sometimes flinches/shows a slight hint of fear on his face whenever Gaki gets mad. This causes a slight strain in their relationship, because Gaki knows exactly why<br>
-He’s constantly in turmoil with his identity over being human or youkai. He doesn’t want to accept being human because that means he’d be like his mother, and yet with this illness, it’s almost impossible to deny.<br>
-he covers his hands with gloves because his fingertips are black. They look like this due to his youkai genetics. He also tends to stay away from mirrors, both because of his similarity to his mother, but also his golden eyes. This is a complete oxymoron on how he thinks vs how he acts. He wants to be a youkai, a monster, to snuff out his humanity, and yet, he avoids and hides the physical features that make him one<br>
-He got one of his friends killed in high school, which is why he argued with his best friend<br>
-He got his mentor killed when he joined Hamori, but not in the way u might think - This mentor was CRUEL. She taught him how to be strong, but also how to snuff out emotional attachment. She set a guideline that he will never be able to surpass her until he kills her. To be able to do that, he both needs to be physically… and emotionally able. They did grow close, with an almost family-like relationship. However, because of her criteria, Gaki was forced to kill someone close to him.

Powers/Abilities: Absolutely none. He is half human, after all. He gained his strength on his own. The only youkai qualities he has are part of his appearance (his hands, his eyes), and his blood too but it still looks human.
