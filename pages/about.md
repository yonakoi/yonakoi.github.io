# **About Me**

Hello! I'm Maya ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧<br><br>
I am committed to transforming my love for games into a successful career. With proficiency in programming languages like C#, Python, Java, and currently learning C++, along with experience in game development tools such as Unity, Visual Studio, Godot, and Unreal, I aspire to specialize in creating interactive and engaging game experiences with life changing stories!
<br>
I am always eager to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and collaborate with talented teams to to not only put my skills to the test, but help them further develop with new and memorable experiences.
