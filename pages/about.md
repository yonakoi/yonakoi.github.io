# **About Me**

Hello! I'm Maya ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧<br><br>
I am committed to transforming my love for games into a successful career. With proficiency in programming languages like C#, Python, Java, and currently learning C++, along with experience in game development tools such as Unity, Visual Studio, Godot, and Unreal, I aspire to specialize in creating interactive and engaging game experiences with life changing stories!
<br><br>
I am always eager to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and collaborate with talented teams to to not only put my skills to the test, but help them further develop with new and memorable experiences.
<br><br>
For a little background on my passion for games and programming, I have appreciated the art and stories of video games since I discovered Undertale. The story, the art, the emotional rollercoaster, all of it inspired me to create. I didn't always know if Game Design was something I wanted to pursue. I dabbled a bit in "coding" in middle school, meaning block coding in scratch, but it didn't pique my interest. That was until about halfway through high school, in my first coding class, when I knew Game Design was the career for me. Solving problems in coding is a satisfaction almost nothing else can compare to. I will actively pursue my dream to change lives the way Undertale changed mine. I want to create to inspire others.
