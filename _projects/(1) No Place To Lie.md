## My Role

I was a Lead Designer. I worked in a team of 3 to create a playable visual novel utilizing RPGMaker MV. I collaborated with my team members to create the narration, character designs, and concept art. On my own, I compiled all game assets, story, and soundtrack for final implementation, as well as created all pixel art assets in game using ReSprite.
