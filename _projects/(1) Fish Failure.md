## Overview

The Fish (with legs) is being hunted down by bullies called fish with arms! Luckily for it, some magical being gave it protection by gifting a gun and shield. Except... The Fish doesn't want it. The Fish then decides to go head first into danger as the gun and shield gain a conscience and protect The Fish with all its might!


## Gameplay

Player One uses WASD to move The Fish around and walk into dangers - the fish with arms, or the bullets they shoot. The Fish can also knock enemies into the void, so be careful! Player One wins when The Fish's health reaches zero.

Player Two uses the Mouse to rotate the gun and shield around The Fish. Clicking the left mouse button allows the gun to shoot, and clicking the right mouse button switches the gun and shield's positions. Player Two wins when all the enemies in the level are dead.


## My Role

For this project, I came up with the 'story' of the game, was the lead and sole art director, and helped with the programming. This project was incredibly fun and exciting to make, as it was my first **real** game. This game highlights my key skills to design, program, thrive in collaborative environments, and bring creative game concepts to life. Being with a team for the first time is a nerve wracking experience, but I believe that this project really highlighted my skills to reach out and communicate, and bring the rest of my team out of their shells as well.

Because this game was made in Monogame, it really honed my skills in C#. Having to do everything manually, I set up the game states, the buttons, and a few mechanics such as health and small effects like bubbles that float from the bottom to the top of the screen. I also coded the walking animation for Player 1. It gave me some difficulty, as this was not only my first time attempting this, but also my first time making a sprite sheet, so I was worried the dimensions were off. However, I was able to push through and get a full frame-by-frame animation in the game. This also applies to our game over screens, where there's a small animated cutscene before giving the players the option to play again.

The art was the first thing I did once we got our ideas down. I worked on the art concepts with my group, and then brought the art to life before getting into the code. Doing all the art taught me what it means to consider every aspect of how to make a program visually appealing. Small things like background items, making the buttons fit the aesthetic, and the bubbles I mentioned earlier are all important into bringing the game to life. I also learned what it means to make game art - there are many different pieces and aspects to visuals, like the detailed screens for menus, or a single sprite for the enemies. I also struggled with making things visually appealing, but also reducing a 'messy' look. Certain things needed to stand out more than others, for example the title and buttons in a title screen need to pop up more so the player can navigate easier. 

Overall, because this was my first game, I had a lot of fun experimenting with different art and struggling with manual coding. I also really appreciated my team because they went so above and beyond in areas that I lack, such as the music and sound effects for the game.
