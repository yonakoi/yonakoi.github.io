description: A game about a fish with legs... that wants to die?? Fish Failure is a competitive 2D two player game. The fish with legs is being hunted down by bullies called fish with arms... but luckily for it, some magical being gave it protection by gifting a gun and shield. Except... the fish with legs doesn't want it. The fish then decides to go head first into danger as the gun and shield gain a conscience and protect the fish with all its might!

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
