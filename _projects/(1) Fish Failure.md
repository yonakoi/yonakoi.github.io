# Overview

The fish with legs is being hunted down by bullies called fish with arms... but luckily for it, some magical being gave it protection by gifting a gun and shield. Except... the fish with legs doesn't want it. The fish then decides to go head first into danger as the gun and shield gain a conscience and protect the fish with all its might!
