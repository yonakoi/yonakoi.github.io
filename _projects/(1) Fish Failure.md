## Overview

The Fish (with legs) is being hunted down by bullies called fish with arms! Luckily for it, some magical being gave it protection by gifting a gun and shield. Except... The Fish doesn't want it. The Fish then decides to go head first into danger as the gun and shield gain a conscience and protect The Fish with all its might!


## Gameplay

Player One uses WASD to move The Fish around and walk into dangers - the fish with arms, or the bullets they shoot. The Fish can also knock enemies into the void, so be careful! Player One wins when The Fish's health reaches zero.

Player Two uses the Mouse to rotate the gun and shield around The Fish. Clicking the left mouse button allows the gun to shoot, and clicking the right mouse button switches the gun and shield's positions. Player Two wins when all the enemies in the level are dead.

## My Role

Because this game was made in Monogame, it really honed my skills in C#. Having to do everything manually, I set up the game states, the buttons, and a few mechanics such as health and small effects like bubbles that float from the bottom to the top of the screen. I also coded the animations for walking and the game over screens, with a bit of help from my teammates.

I was the lead and sole art director in this project. Doing all the art taught me what it means to consider every aspect of how to make a program visually appealing. Small things like background items, making the buttons fit the aesthetic, and the bubbles I mentioned earlier are all important into bringing the game to life.

Overall, because this was my first game, I had a lot of fun experimenting with different art and struggling with manual coding. I also really appreciated my team because they went so above and beyond in areas that I lack, such as the music and sound effects for the game.
